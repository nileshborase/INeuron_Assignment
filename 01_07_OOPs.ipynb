    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "The primary goal of object-oriented programming (OOP) is to simplify the development and maintenance of large software programs by providing a way to group data and functionality together.\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "An object in Python is a real-world entity or concept that has been modeled in code. It has data and methods associated with it. For example, a car object might have data members like name, color, and make, and methods like drive() and brake().\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and methods that all objects of that class will have. For example, the Car class might define the data members and methods mentioned above.\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "Attributes and methods are the two main components of a class. Attributes are variables that are associated with an object, while methods are functions that are associated with an object.\n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "The difference between class variables and instance variables is that class variables are shared by all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance. For example, the Car class might have a class variable called MAX_SPEED that is shared by all car objects. Each car object would also have its own instance variable called current_speed.\n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "The self parameter in Python class methods refers to the current object. It is used to access the object's attributes and methods.\n"
