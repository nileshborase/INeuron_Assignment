    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs because they allow code to be reused and modularized. This makes code more efficient and easier to maintain. Functions can also be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a function runs when the function is called. A function can be called from anywhere in the program, including from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The def statement creates a function. The syntax for creating a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "  # Function body\n",
    "\n",
    "The function body contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that can be reused. A function call is an invocation of a function. When a function is called, the Python interpreter executes the code in the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one global scope in a Python program. The global scope is the scope that is available to all code in the program, including functions. There are as many local scopes as there are function calls. A local scope is the scope that is available to the code inside a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call returns, all variables in the local scope are destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a return value is the value that is returned by a function. A return value can be any Python object, including None. It is possible to have a return value in an expression. For example, the following expression returns the value of the x variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "return x\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function does not have a return statement, the return value of a call to that function is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a function variable refer to the global variable, you can use the global keyword. For example, the following code makes the x variable in the f() function refer to the global x variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "  global x\n",
    "  x += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "f()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "11\n",
    "The data type of None is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence import are all your pets namederic do is a syntax error. The correct syntax for importing a module is import module_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had a bacon() feature in a spam module, I would call it spam.bacon() after importing spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things you can do to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error. One common approach is to use try and except statements. The try statement allows you to enclose a block of code that is likely to raise an exception. The except statement allows you to handle the exception if it is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code will prevent the program from crashing if the open() function raises an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  file = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "  print(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to save a program from crashing is to use logging to log errors. This can be helpful for debugging the program later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try clause is used to enclose a block of code that is likely to raise an exception. The except clause is used to handle the exception if it is raised.\n",
    "The following code shows how to use try and except statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  # Code that is likely to raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "  # Handle the exception\n",
    "\n",
    "The except clause can also be used to handle specific exceptions. For example, the following code will handle a FileNotFoundError exception if the open() function raises one:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  file = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "  print(\"File not found\")"
