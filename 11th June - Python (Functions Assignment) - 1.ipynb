    "1. What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function. It is defined using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments part of the lambda function definition specifies the arguments that the function can accept. The expression part of the lambda function definition specifies the code that the function will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are different from regular functions in that they are anonymous and can only contain one expression. Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with other functions, such as the map(), filter(), and reduce() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can a lambda function in Python have multiple arguments? If yes, how can you define and use\n",
    "them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a lambda function in Python can have multiple arguments. To define a lambda function with multiple arguments, you simply list the arguments in a comma-separated list before the expression. For example, the following lambda function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "sum_function = lambda a, b: a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a lambda function with multiple arguments, you simply pass the arguments to the function like you would with any other Python function. For example, the following code shows how to use the sum_function lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "sum = sum_function(1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "3. How are lambda functions typically used in Python? Provide an example use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are typically used to perform simple tasks that do not require a full-fledged function. For example, you could use a lambda function to sort a list of numbers, filter a list of items, or perform a mathematical operation on a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use a lambda function to sort a list of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sorted_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in\n",
    "Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of lambda functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "They are concise and easy to read.\n",
    "They are efficient, as they are only evaluated when they are called.\n",
    "They can be used inline, without having to define a named function first.\n",
    "Limitations of lambda functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "They can only contain one expression.\n",
    "They cannot be used to define recursive functions.\n",
    "They can be difficult to debug, as they do not have a name.\n",
    "5. Are lambda functions in Python able to access variables defined outside of their own scope?\n",
    "Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, lambda functions in Python are able to access variables defined outside of their own scope. This is because lambda functions are created in the same scope as the function that they are called in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a lambda function that accesses a variable defined outside of its own scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "global_variable = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "  lambda_function = lambda: global_variable\n",
    "  return lambda_function\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda_function = my_function()\n",
    "result = lambda_function()\n",

    "8. Implement a lambda function to filter out all the even numbers from a list of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "filter_even_numbers = lambda numbers: [number for number in numbers if number % 2 != 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "This lambda function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all of the odd numbers from the original list.\n",

    "\n",
