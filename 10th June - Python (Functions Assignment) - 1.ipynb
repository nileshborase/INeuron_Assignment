    "1. In Python, what is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "A built-in function is a function that is pre-defined in the Python language. Built-in functions are available to use in any Python program without having to import any additional modules. Some examples of built-in functions include print(), len(), and abs().\n",
    "\n",
    "A user-defined function is a function that is defined by the programmer. User-defined functions are typically used to perform specific tasks that are not covered by the built-in functions. For example, a programmer might create a user-defined function to calculate the area of a triangle or to find the average of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a built-in function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def print(object, *, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Args:\n",
    "    object: The object to print.\n",
    "    sep: String separator to use between values. The default is ' '.\n",
    "    end: String to print after the last value. The default is '\\n'.\n",
    "    file: A writable object to print to. The default is sys.stdout.\n",
    "    flush: Whether to flush the stream after printing. The default is False.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a user-defined function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def calculate_area_of_triangle(base, height):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Calculates the area of a triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Args:\n",
    "    base: The base of the triangle.\n",
    "    height: The height of the triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Returns:\n",
    "    The area of the triangle.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  area = (base * height) / 2\n",
    "  return area\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "2. How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional\n",
    "arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass arguments to a function in Python, you simply list the arguments in parentheses after the function name. For example, to call the calculate_area_of_triangle() function from the previous example, you would pass in the base and height of the triangle as arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "area = calculate_area_of_triangle(5, 3)\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "Positional arguments are arguments that are passed to a function in the order in which they are defined in the function definition. Keyword arguments are arguments that are passed to a function by name. Keyword arguments are typically used when you need to pass a specific argument to a function, even if the argument is not in the first position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code shows how to pass keyword arguments to the calculate_area_of_triangle() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "area = calculate_area_of_triangle(height=3, base=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the keyword arguments does not matter, as long as the argument names match the argument names in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return\n",
    "statements? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the return statement in a function is to return a value from the function. A function can only have one return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following calculate_area_of_triangle() function returns the area of the triangle:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def calculate_area_of_triangle(base, height):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Calculates the area of a triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Args:\n",
    "    base: The base of the triangle.\n",
    "    height: The height of the triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Returns:\n",
    "    The area of the triangle.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  area = (base * height) / 2\n",
    "  return area\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows how to call the calculate_area_of_triangle() function and store the returned value in the variable area:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "area = calculate_area_of_triangle(5, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable area will now contain the value 7.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an\n",
    "example where a lambda function can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function. Lambda functions are defined using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments part of the lambda function definition specifies the arguments that the function can accept. The expression part of the lambda function definition specifies the code that the function will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are different from regular functions in that they are anonymous and can only contain one expression. Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with other functions, such as the map(), filter(), and reduce() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "double_function = lambda x: x * 2\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "This lambda function takes a number as input and returns the number multiplied by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use the double_function lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "doubled_numbers = map(double_function, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(doubled_numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "Lambda functions can be very useful for performing simple tasks that do not require a full-fledged function. For example, you could use a lambda function to sort a list of numbers or to filter a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local\n",
    "scope and global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope in Python refers to the visibility of variables within a program. There are two types of scope in Python: local scope and global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope refers to the variables that are defined within a function. Local variables are only visible to the function in which they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global scope refers to the variables that are defined outside of any function. Global variables are visible to all functions in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a function with a local variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "  local_variable = 10\n",
    "  return local_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_function())\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "10\n",
    "The variable local_variable is only visible to the my_function() function. If you try to access the local_variable variable outside of the my_function() function, you will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a function that accesses a global variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "global_variable = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "  return global_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_function())\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "20\n",
    "The variable global_variable is visible to all functions in the program, including the my_function() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be aware of the concept of scope in Python, as it can help you to avoid errors and write more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How can you use the \"return\" statement in a Python function to return multiple values?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to return multiple values from a Python function:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a tuple.\n",
    "You can use a dictionary.\n",
    "To return multiple values from a function using a tuple, you simply list the values in a comma-separated list. For example, the following function returns the first and last name of a person:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def get_first_and_last_name(full_name):\n",
    "  first_name, last_name = full_name.split()\n",
    "  return first_name, last_name\n",
    "\n",
    "first_name, last_name = get_first_and_last_name(\"John Doe\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(first_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "John\n",
    "To return multiple values from a function using a dictionary, you simply create a dictionary and add the values to the dictionary. For example, the following function returns the age and height of a person:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def get_age_and_height(person):\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    \"age\": person[\"age\"],\n",
    "    \"height\": person[\"height\"]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "age, height = get_age_and_height({\n",
    "  \"age\": 30,\n",
    "  \"height\": 180\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(age)\n",
    "print(height)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "30\n",
    "180\n",
    "Which method you choose to use to return multiple values from a function depends on your specific needs. If you need to return a"
