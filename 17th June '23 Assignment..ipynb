    "The role of try and exception block:\n",
    "The try and except block is used to handle errors in Python. It allows you to continue executing your program even if an error occurs.\n",

    "The syntax for a basic try-except block:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "  # Code to handle the exception\n",

    "What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block:\n",
    "If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block, the program will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type:\n",
    "A bare except block will handle any type of exception. A except block that specifies a specific exception type will only handle that specific type of exception.\n",

    "Can you have nested try-except blocks in Python? If yes, then give an example.\n",
