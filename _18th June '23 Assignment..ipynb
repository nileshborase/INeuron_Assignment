    "1. What is the role of the else block in a try-except statement? Provide an example scenario where it would be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block in a try-except statement is used to execute code if no exception occurs in the try block. This can be useful for performing cleanup operations or logging a successful event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a try-except statement with an else block:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  # Code to execute if no exception occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code uses the else block to log a message to the console if the file can be opened successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  with open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    file_contents = f.read()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"File opened successfully.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can a try-except block be nested inside another try-except block? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a try-except block can be nested inside another try-except block. This can be useful for handling different types of exceptions in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a nested try-except statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  # Outer try block\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "    # Inner try block\n",
    "  except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the inner exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  # Code to execute if no exception occurs in the inner try block\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "  # Code to handle the outer exception\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code uses nested try-except blocks to handle different types of exceptions that may occur when opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "    with open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "      file_contents = f.read()\n",
    "  except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "  except PermissionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Permission denied.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "  print(\"An unexpected error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can you create a custom exception class in Python? Provide an example that demonstrates its usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom exception class in Python, you can inherit from the Exception class. Your custom exception class can contain additional attributes to store information about the exception, such as the error code or the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a custom exception class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "class MyCustomException(Exception):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, error_code, error_message):\n",
    "    self.error_code = error_code\n",
    "    self.error_message = error_message\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __str__(self):\n",
    "    return f\"MyCustomException: {self.error_code} - {self.error_message}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To use your custom exception class, you can simply raise it in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "raise MyCustomException(100, \"This is my custom exception message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also catch your custom exception class in a try-except statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  # Code that may raise a MyCustomException\n",
    "except MyCustomException as e:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are some common exceptions that are built into Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common exceptions that are built into Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "ArithmeticError: Raised when an arithmetic operation results in an error, such as dividing by zero.\n",
    "AssertionError: Raised when an assertion fails.\n",
    "EOFError: Raised when the end of a file is reached.\n",
    "FloatingPointError: Raised when a floating-point operation results in an overflow or underflow.\n",
    "IndexError: Raised when an index is out of range.\n",
    "ImportError: Raised when a module cannot be imported.\n",
    "KeyError: Raised when a key does not exist in a dictionary.\n",
    "MemoryError: Raised when the program runs out of memory.\n",
    "NameError: Raised when a name is not defined.\n",
    "OverflowError: Raised when an arithmetic operation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the program.\n",
    "SyntaxError: Raised when the program encounters a syntax error.\n",
    "TypeError: Raised when an operation is performed on a value that is of the wrong type.\n",
    "ValueError: Raised when an operation is performed on a value that is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging in Python is a mechanism for recording events that happen when some software runs. It is a powerful tool that can be used for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is important in software development because it can help developers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand how their programs are working and what is happening inside them.\n",
    "Identify and fix bugs in their programs.\n",
    "Investigate problems that occur when their programs are running in production.\n",
    "Monitor the performance and health of their programs.\n",
    "6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when\n",
    "each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log levels in Python logging are used to indicate the severity of a log message. There are five standard log levels, in order of increasing severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: Used for detailed information about the internal workings of a program.\n",
    "INFO: Used for general information about the execution of a program.\n",
    "WARNING: Used for non-critical errors or potential problems.\n",
    "ERROR: Used for critical errors that prevent the program from functioning as expected.\n",
    "CRITICAL: Used for catastrophic errors that cause the program to crash.\n",
    "Developers can choose which log levels to enable and which log messages to write to different destinations. For example, they may want to log all DEBUG messages to a file, but only log ERROR and CRITICAL messages to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of when each log level would be appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: When a program starts up, it could log a DEBUG message indicating that it has started successfully.\n",
    "INFO: When a program completes a task, it could log an INFO message indicating that the task has been completed.\n",
    "WARNING: When a program encounters a minor error, such as a missing file, it could log a WARNING message indicating the error.\n",
    "ERROR: When a program encounters a critical error, such as a database connection failure, it could log an ERROR message indicating the error.\n",
    "CRITICAL: When a program crashes, it could log a CRITICAL message indicating the reason for the crash.\n",
    "7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log\n",
    "message format using formatters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Log formatters in Python logging are used to format log messages before they are written to a destination. By default, log messages are formatted in a simple format that includes the log level, timestamp, and message text. However, developers can use log formatters to customize the format of log messages to meet their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize the format of log messages using formatters, developers can create a custom log formatter class that inherits from the logging.Formatter class. The custom log formatter class can then override the format() method to format log messages in the desired way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a custom log formatter class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyCustomLogFormatter(logging.Formatter):\n",
    "  def format(self, record):\n",
    "    return f\"[{record.levelname}] [{record.created}] {record.message}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger object\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the log formatter\n",
    "logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\n",
    "logger.handler.setFormatter(MyCustomLogFormatter())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log a message\n",
    "logger.info(\"This is a custom log message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This example code will log the message \"This is a custom log message.\" to the console with the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "[INFO] [2023-09-23 11:13:22] This is a custom log message.\n",
    "8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or\n",
    "classes in a Python application?\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application, developers can use the logging.getLogger() function to create a logger object for each module or class. The logger object can then be used to log messages to the desired destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger object for each module or class\n",
    "logger1 = logging.getLogger(\"module1\")\n",
    "logger2 = logging.getLogger(\"module2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the log formatter\n",
    "logger1.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\n",
    "logger2.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\n",
    "logger1.handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter())\n",
    "logger2.handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log messages from each module or class\n",
    "logger1.info(\"This is a message from module1.\")\n",
    "logger2.info(\"This is a message from module2.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or\n",
    "classes in a Python application?\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the logging module.\n",
    "Create a logger object for each module or class using the logging.getLogger() function.\n",
    "Configure the logger object to log messages to the desired destination.\n",
    "Use the logger object to log messages from each module or class.\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger object for each module or class\n",
    "logger1 = logging.getLogger(\"module1\")\n",
    "logger2 = logging.getLogger(\"module2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure the logger object to log messages to the console\n",
    "logger1.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\n",
    "logger2.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the logger object to log messages from each module or class\n",
    "logger1.info(\"This is a message from module1.\")\n",
    "logger2.info(\"This is a message from module2.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When\n",
    "should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging statement and the print() statement are both used to print output to the console. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging statements are more powerful and flexible than print statements. Logging statements can be used to log messages to different destinations, such as files, databases, and email servers. Logging statements also support log levels, which allow you to filter and prioritize log messages.\n",
    "Print statements are simpler and easier to use than logging statements. Print statements simply print output to the console. Print statements do not support log levels or multiple destinations.\n",
    "You should use logging statements over print statements in a real-world application when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Log messages to different destinations, such as files, databases, and email servers.\n",
    "Filter and prioritize log messages using log levels.\n",
    "Use a logging framework to manage your log messages.\n",
    "10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the\n",
    "following requirements:\n",
    "● The log message should be \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "● The log level should be set to \"INFO.\"\n",
    "● The log file should append new log entries without overwriting previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the specified requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",

    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the log level to INFO\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a file handler\n",
    "file_handler = logging.FileHandler(\"app.log\", mode=\"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add the file handler to the logger\n",
    "logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n",
    "\n",

    "logger.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Create a Python program that logs an error message to the console and a file named\n",
    "\"errors.log\" if an exception occurs during the program's execution. The error\n",
